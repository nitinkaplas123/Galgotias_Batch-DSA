String data structure is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming,
representing a sequence of characters. These characters can be letters, digits, 
symbols, or even whitespace.

In most programming languages, strings are typically enclosed within quotation marks 
(single or double) to differentiate them from other data types.

For example:
"Hello, World!"
