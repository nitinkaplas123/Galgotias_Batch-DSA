BST-:
BST commonly refers to Binary Search Tree, which is a fundamental data structure 
used in computer science and programming. It's a type of binary tree in which 
each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right
child. 

In a BST, for every node:
1)All elements in the left subtree are less than the node's value.
2)All elements in the right subtree are greater than the node's value.
3)BSTs are commonly used for data storage and retrieval operations like 
  searching, insertion, and deletion, because they allow for efficient 
  search operations with a time complexity of O(log n) on average, 
  where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
