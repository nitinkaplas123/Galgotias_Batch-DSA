Deque-:
Deque or Double Ended Queue is a generalized version of Queue data structure that allows insert and 
delete at both ends.

Operations on Deque:
1)push_front()
Inserts the element at the beginning.
2)push_back()
Adds element at the end.
3)pop_front()
Removes the first element from the deque.
4)pop_back()
Removes the last element from the deque.
5)front()	
Gets the front element from the deque.	
6)back()	
Gets the last element from the deque.	
7)empty()	
Checks whether the deque is empty or not.	
8)size()	
Determines the number of elements in the deque.	


Applications of Deque-:
Since Deque supports both stack and queue operations, it can be used as both. 
The Deque data structure supports clockwise and anticlockwise rotations in O(1) 
time which can be useful in certain applications. Also, the problems where elements
need to be removed and or added to both ends can be efficiently solved using Deque.
