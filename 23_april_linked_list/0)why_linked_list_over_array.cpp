Arrays and linked lists are both fundamental data structures used in computer science and programming,
each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Let's discuss a scenario where a problem with arrays can be
mitigated by using a linked list instead.



1)One common issue with arrays is their fixed size. Once an array is created, its size typically cannot be changed dynamically. 
If you need to store more elements than the array can hold, you either have to allocate a new, larger array and copy the elements
over (which can be inefficient), or you risk running out of space and encountering errors.

2)Linked lists, on the other hand, can grow or shrink dynamically, as needed. Each element in a linked list is stored in a separate node,
 and each node contains a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion
 of elements anywhere in the list.

3)Consider a scenario where you need to implement a data structure to store a collection of elements, but the number of elements is not
 known in advance and may vary over time. If you use an array for this purpose, you might run into issues if the array becomes full or 
 if you waste memory by allocating more space than necessary. 

 However, by using a linked list, you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about resizing the data structure.


In summary, using a linked list can help overcome the limitations of arrays, such as fixed size and inefficient resizing,
especially in scenarios where the number of elements is dynamic and unpredictable.
